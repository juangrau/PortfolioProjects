## Data Cleaning with SQL
This project includes a series of SQL Queries oriented to clean some data regarding the housing market in Nashville.

The idea is to show that there is a good amount of data cleansing that can be done directly on the database using SQL queries, instead of working with the data using phyton/pandas.

The project includes the source data on an Excel file and the SQL file with all the queries that were performed on the data.
